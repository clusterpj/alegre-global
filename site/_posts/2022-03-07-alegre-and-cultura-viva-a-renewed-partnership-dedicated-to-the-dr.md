With the current state of the world, strong bonds between like minded individuals and groups are vital to making things better for ourselves and our children.

A strong bond is exactly how one could describe the partnership between **Alegre and the Dominican foundation, Cultura Viva.** Both organizations have a singular mission: to uplift the Dominican people and both organizations spend all of their time establishing ways to do just that.

### After unanimous approval as of August 31st, Alegre’s Board of Directors have greenlit another 4 months of financial support to Cultura Viva!  

<br>
This funding will ensure [Cultura Viva Foundation’s](www.culturaviva.org) vital work can continue through the end of 2020.
Work such as:

- Bringing food to hungry families.
- Putting on educational and entertainment events for underprivileged children. 
- Funding music education for Dominican youth.
- Developing a nationwide Telemedicine service.
- Helping to establish a top of the line medical facility on the North coast of the DR. 

Since 2019 Alegre’s partnership with [Cultura Viva](www.culturaviva.org) has impacted over 20,000 Dominican lives, and with this newest grant given, that partnership will no doubt help thousands more!
